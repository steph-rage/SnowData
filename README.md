# Snow Data 

This Python program currently uses web scraping and Beautiful Soup to get information from a website about snow level's at Hart's Pass, WA and save them to a database.

## Work in Progress - Next Steps

So far the web scraping is successful, but gets way more than one number pay day! Working on figuring out why and fixing that. Next up, trying to figure out the most interesting ways to organize the data in the database - how could a user click different options to get answers to different questions?


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Download the requirements.txt file and run

		pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running

After installing the program, you can run the .py file using Python (which creates and populates a database), or you can use the already created database included in the program.
